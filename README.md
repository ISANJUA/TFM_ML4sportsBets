# TFM_ML4sportsBets
Final Project: Master on DS (4th ed.)
## Introduction:
Sporting bets are the oldest bets known, having existed since the Ancient Greece. Since then, lots of studies who tried to predict the result of any sportive event have emerged. Nevertheless, it is not until the first decade of twenty-first century with the boom of internet, when sporting bets experienced a dramatic rise in popularity. The new technologies on data analysis have made obsolete all those old studies and have opened a door to investigate the applicability of new methods to the prediction.
## Objective:
Investigate the range of possibilities that Machine Learning bring to this field of study. The final aim of this project is create some models with ML and analyse its predictive ability in terms of ROI (return on investment).
